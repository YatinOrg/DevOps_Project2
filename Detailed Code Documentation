- This line specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

```
- These lines provide comments that serve as documentation for the script. They include information about the script's purpose, expected input, owner, creation date, last edit date, modifications made, and contact information for issues.

```bash
helper()
```
- This line seems to be a placeholder for a function named `helper`. However, there is an issue with the syntax. It should be `function helper()` instead of just `helper()`.

```bash
# GitHub API URL
API_URL="https://api.github.com"
```
- This line declares a variable `API_URL` and assigns it the GitHub API's base URL.

```bash
# GitHub username and personal access token
USERNAME=$username
TOKEN=$token
```
- These two lines declare variables `USERNAME` and `TOKEN` to store the GitHub username and personal access token, respectively. Note that `$username` and `$token` need to be replaced with actual GitHub credentials when running the script.

```bash
# User and Repository information
REPO_OWNER=$1
REPO_NAME=$2
```
- These lines capture command-line arguments. `$1` represents the first argument (GitHub repository owner), and `$2` represents the second argument (GitHub repository name). These values are expected to be provided when running the script.

```bash
# Function to make a GET request to the GitHub API
function github_api_get {
    local endpoint="$1"
    local url="${API_URL}/${endpoint}"

    # Send a GET request to the GitHub API with authentication
    curl -s -u "${USERNAME}:${TOKEN}" "$url"
}
```
- This block defines a Bash function `github_api_get` that takes an endpoint as an argument and constructs the complete URL using the GitHub API URL and the provided endpoint. It then uses `curl` to make a silent GET request to that URL with authentication.

```bash
# Function to list users with read access to the repository
function list_users_with_read_access {
    local endpoint="repos/${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/collaborators"

    # Fetch the list of collaborators on the repository
    collaborators="$(github_api_get "$endpoint" | jq -r '.[] | select(.permissions.pull == true) | .login')"

    # Display the list of collaborators with read access
    if [[ -z "$collaborators" ]]; then
        echo "No users with read access found for ${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}."
    else
        echo "Users with read access to ${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}:"
        echo "$collaborators"
    fi
}
```
- This block defines another Bash function named `list_users_with_read_access` that lists users with read access to the specified GitHub repository. It uses the `github_api_get` function to fetch the list of collaborators from the GitHub API, filters the list using `jq` to include only those with pull access, and then prints the result.

```bash
# Helper Function
function helper{
expected_no_of_args = 2
if[$# -ne $expected_no_of_args]; then
echo "please execute the script with expected cmd args"
echo "asd"
}
```
- This block attempts to define a function named `helper` but contains syntax errors. It seems like it's meant to check the number of command-line arguments and provide a message if the expected number is not met.

```bash
# Main script
echo "Listing users with read access to ${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}..."
list_users_with_read_access
```
- This section initiates the main script. It prints a message indicating the repository for which it is listing users with read access and then calls the `list_users_with_read_access` function.
